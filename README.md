- USING IMMERSIVE LABS
- SUDO CODE - See certificate
- CHALLENGES FACED - Once again I enjoyed this weeks home learning challenges as we got to use immersive labs to complete our tasks. The one I found the most difficult was 'Elf on a Shelf'. I had to run an 'elf locator command', follow the clues to the next directory, run the elf locator command every time I found a new elf.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - It took me a good 40 minutes to complete the elf on a shelf lab as there was a lot of digging around in different directories involved however I did still enjoy it and was very happy when I finally located the elf!!

- SESSION 2 - Sudo Lab, File command Lab, Text Editors Lab
- BRIEF - Complete all the labs given in this weeks session. 
- USING IMMERSIVE LABS
- SUDO CODE - See certificate
- CHALLENGES FACED - Working with new commmands in linux was fun, I enjoyed seeing what each new command could achieve.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - TO be honest, I found this week quite simple and enjoyable to do.


- SESSION 3 - Episode 2 Lab, Linux File Permissions Lab
- BRIEF - Complete all the labs given in this weeks session. 
- USING IMMERSIVE LABS
- SUDO CODE - See certificate
- CHALLENGES FACED - This week was a bit trickier as we were taught about the different permissions involved within linux. Also learnt about the differnt modes needed to make these permissions.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I feel like I did a lot more reading for this weeks lab than I did previously. I also found that I had to go digging around the internet a bit more to help with my solutions.

- SESSION 4 - IP Addresses Lab, Networking Internet Protocol Lab, Going Places Lab
- BRIEF - Complete all the labs given in this weeks session. 
- USING IMMERSIVE LABS
- SUDO CODE - See certificate
- CHALLENGES FACED - I had fun learning about the different IP addresses and how they are given out and what they are made up of. There was a lot I didn't quite understand so the session and the labs really helped with that.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - Again, this weeks labs were a bit trickier as I guess as each week goes by we are sup-posed to be grasping a better knowledge of each subject which I do feel like I am.
