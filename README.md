- CHALLENGES FACED - Once again I enjoyed this weeks home learning challenges as we got to use immersive labs to complete our tasks. The one I found the most difficult was 'Elf on a Shelf'. I had to run an 'elf locator command', follow the clues to the next directory, run the elf locator command every time I found a new elf.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - It took me a good 40 minutes to complete the elf on a shelf lab as there was a lot of digging around in different directories involved however I did still enjoy it and was very happy when I finally located the elf!!
